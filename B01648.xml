         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Confeſsion of Faith.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Beleeve that nothing is without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning but God, no nature, no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, no ſpirit but one and the ſame God; That God as he is eternall, almighty, onely wiſe, onely good in his nature, ſo he is eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonne and Spirit in perſons.</p>
            <p>I beleeve that God is ſo holy, pure, and jealous, as it is impoſſible for him to be pleaſed in any creature, though the worke of his owne hands: So that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angell, Man, nor World, could ſtand or can ſtand one moment in his eyes, without the beholding of the ſame in the face of a Mediatour; and therefore that before him, with whom all things are preſent, the Lamb of God was ſlaine before all worlds, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which eternall councell of his it was impoſſible for him to have deſcended to any work of creation, but he ſhould have enjoyed the bleſſed and individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſociety of three Perſons in Godhead onely for ever. But that out of his eternall and infinite goodneſſe and love, purpoſing to become a Creator, and communicate with his creatures, he ordained in his eternall councell, that one perſon of the Godhead ſhould be united to one nature, and to one particular of his creatures, that ſo in the perſon of the Mediatour
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:179735:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 48 -->the true ladder might be fixed, whereby God might deſcend to his creatures, and his creatures aſcend unto him: So that God by the reconcilement of the Mediatour, turning his countenance towards his creatures, (though not in the ſame light and degree) made way unto the diſpenſation of his moſt holy and ſecret will; whereby ſome of his creatures might ſtand and keepe their ſtate, others might fall and be reſtored, and others might fall and not be reſtored in their ſtate, but yet remaine in their beeing, though under wrath and corruption, all with reſpect unto the Mediatour; which is the great myſterie, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect center of all Gods wayes with his creatures, and unto which all his other works and wonders do but ſerve and refer.</p>
            <p>That hee choſe (according to his good pleaſure) man to be that creature, to whoſe nature the perſon of the eternall Son of God ſhould be united: And amongſt the generations of men, elected a ſmall ſtock, in whom (by the participation of himſelfe) he purpoſed to expreſſe the riches of his glory: all the miniſtration of Angels, damnation of Divels and Reprobates, and univerſall adminiſtration of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and diſpenſation of all times, having no other end, but, as the wayes and ambages of God, to be further glorified in his Saints, who are one with the Mediatour, who is one with God.</p>
            <p>That by the vertue of this his eternall councell touching a Mediatour, he deſcended at his own good pleaſure, and according to the times and ſeaſons to himſelfe knowne, to become Creator, who by his eternall Word created all things, and by his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:179735:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 48 -->eternall Spirit doth comfort and preſerve them.</p>
            <p>That he made all things in their firſt eſtate good, and removed from himſelf the beginning of all evill and vanity unto the liberty of the creature, but reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in himſelfe the beginning of all reſtitution, to the libertie of his grace, uſing nevertheleſſe, and turning the falling and defection of the creature, (which was to his preſcience eternally knowne) to make way to his eternall councell touching a Mediatour, and the worke hee purpoſed to accompliſh in him.</p>
            <p>That God created Spirits, whereof ſome kept their ſtandings and others fell, hee created Heaven and Earth, and all their Armies, and Generations, and gave them conſtant and everlaſting lawes which we call nature, which is nothing but the laws of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which lawes nevertheleſſe have had three chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or times, and are to have a fourth or laſt: The firſt, when the matter of heaven and earth was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated without formes. The ſecond, the <hi>interim</hi> of perfection of every dayes worke. The third, by the curſe, which notwithſtanding was no new creation: And the laſt at the end of the world, the manner whereof is not yet fully revealed: So that the lawes of nature which remaine, and now governe inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly till the end of the world, began to be in force when God firſt reſted from his workes, and ceaſed to create; but received a revocation in part by the curſe, ſince which time they change not.</p>
            <p>That notwithſtanding God hath reſted and ceaſed from Creation ſince the firſt Sabbath, yet, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, de doth accompliſh and fulfill his divine will in all things, great and ſmall, ſingular and generall,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:179735:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 49 -->as fully &amp; exactly by providence, as he could by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle and new creation, though his working be not immediate and direct, but by compaſſe; not viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting nature, which is his owne law upon the creature.</p>
            <p>That at the firſt the ſoule of man was not produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by heaven or earth, but was breathed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly from God; ſo that the wayes and proceedings of God with Spirits, are not included in nature, in the lawes of heaven and earth, but are reſerved to the law of his ſecret will and grace, wherein God worketh ſtill, and reſteth not from perfecting the worke of redemption, as he reſteth from the worke of creation, but continueth working till the end of the world; what time that worke alſo ſhall bee accompliſhed, and an eternall Sabbath ſhall enſue. Likewiſe, that whenſoever God doth tranſcend the law of nature by miracles, (which may ever ſeem as new creations) hee never commeth to that point or paſſe, but in regard of the worke of redemption which is the greater, and whereto all Gods ſignes and miracles doe referre.</p>
            <p>That God created man in his owne Image, in a reaſonable ſoule, in innocencie, in free-will and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigntie: That he gave him a Law and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was in his power to keepe, but he kept it not: That man made a totall defection from God, preſuming to imagine that the Commandments and prohibitions of God, were not the rules of good and evill, but that good and evill had their owne principles and beginnings; and luſted after the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe ſuppoſed beginnings, to the end to depend no more upon Gods will revealed, but upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:179735:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 49 -->himſelf and his own light as a God, then which there could not be a ſin more oppoſite to the whole Law of God: That yet nevertheleſſe this great ſin was not originally moved by the malice of man, but was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated by the ſuggeſtion and inſtigation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, who was the firſt defective creature, and fell of malice and not by temptation from another.</p>
            <p>That upon the fall of man, death and vanitie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by the Juſtice of God, and the Image of God in man was defaced, and heaven and earth which were made for mans uſe, were ſubdued to corruption by his fall: But then that inſtantly and without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of time, after the word of Gods Law became, through the fall of man, fruſtrate, as concerning obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, there ſucceeded the greater word of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that the righteouſneſſe of God might bee wrought by faith.</p>
            <p>That as well the Law of God, as the Word of his promiſe endure the ſame for ever, but that they have beene revealed in ſeverall manners, according to the diſpenſation of times: For the Law was firſt imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in that remnant of light of nature which was left after the fall, being ſufficent to accuſe; then it was more manifeſtly expreſſed in the written Law, and was yet more opened by the Prophets, and laſtly expounded in the true perfection by the Son of God, the great Prophet and perfect interpreter of the Law.</p>
            <p>That likewiſe the word of the promiſe was manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted &amp; revealed, firſt by immediate revelation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, after by figures, which were of two natures; the one the Rites and Ceremonies of the Law, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the continuall Hiſtorie of the old world, and the

               <!-- PDF PAGE 50 -->Church of the Jewes, which though it bee literally true, yet it is for the moſt part pregnant of an Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie and ſhadow of the worke of the redemption to follow: The ſame promiſe or Evangel, was more clearly revealed and declared by the Prophets, and then by the Son himſelfe, and laſtly by the holy Ghoſt, which illuminateth the Church to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>That in the fulneſſe of time, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and oath, of a choſen lineage deſcended the bleſſed ſeed of the Woman, Jeſus Chriſt, the onely begotten Son of God, and Saviour of the world, who was conceived by the power and over-ſhadowing of the holy Ghoſt, and tooke fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> That the Word did not onely take fleſh, or was joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to fleſh, but was made fleſh, though without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of ſubſtance or nature; ſo that the eternall Son of God, and bleſſed Sonne of <hi>Mary</hi> was one perſon: So as the bleſſed Virgin may be truly and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly called <hi>Deipara,</hi> the Mother of God; ſo one, as there is no unitie in univerſall nature, not that of the ſoule and body of man, ſo perfect: For the three heavenly unities, whereof that is the ſecond, exceed all naturall unities; the unitie firſt of the three perſons in the God head: ſecondly, of God &amp; man in Chriſt: thirdly, of Chriſt and the Church, the holy Ghoſt being the worker of both theſe latter unities, for by the holy Ghoſt was Chriſt incarnate and quickned in the fleſh, and by the holy Ghoſt is man regenerate and quickned in the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>That Jeſus the Lord became in the fleſh a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer and ſacrifice for ſinne, a ſatisfaction to the

            <p>That in time, Jeſus the Lord was borne in the dayes of <hi>Herod,</hi> and ſuffered under the government of <hi>Ponce Pilate</hi> being deputy of the Romans, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the high Prieſthood of <hi>Caiphas,</hi> was betrayed by <hi>Judas</hi> one of the twelve Apoſtles, and was crucified at Jeruſalem, and after a true and naturall death, and his body laid in the ſepulchre, the third day he raiſed himſelfe from the bond of death, and roſe and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelfe to many choſen witneſſes by the ſpace of divers dayes, and at the end of thoſe dayes, in the ſight of many, aſcended into heaven, where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth his interceſſion, and ſhall from thence at the day appointed, come in great glory to judge the world.</p>

            <p>That the word of God, whereby his will is revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, continued in revelation and tradition untill <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that the Scriptures were from <hi>Moſes</hi> time, to the times of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, in whoſe age, when after the comming of the holy Ghoſt, the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of all truth, they had delivered the tradition of Scripture, the book of the Scripture was ſhut &amp; cloſed, ſo as not to receive any new addition: And that the Church hath no power over the Scriptures, to teach or command any thing contrary to the written word, but is as the Arke wherein the tables of the firſt Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament were kept and preſerved, that is to ſay, the Church hath onely the cuſtody and delivery over of the Scriptures committed unto the ſame, together with the interpretation of them, but ſuch onely as is conceived by themſelves.</p>
            <p>That there is an univerſall or Catholicke Church of God diſperſed over the face of the earth, which is Chriſts Spouſe and body, being gathered of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the old world, of the Church of the Jewes, of the ſpirits of the faithfull diſſolved, of the ſpirits of the faithfull militant, and of the names yet to be borne which are already written in the booke of life.
